# Personal-Website
After searching through beginner level Computer Science projects that I could do, I 
found making a personal website to be the most approachable, so this is the first ever
project I've developed. I would like to use this website to provide general information 
about me, as well as showcase future projects. Through the process, I have learned a lot about
HTML and CSS.
